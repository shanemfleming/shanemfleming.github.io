  <h1>
    This is my Assignment 2 Web Page!
  </h1>
  <p>
    So far, I have learned how URLs and the web work, 
    but I have not tried my hand at making webpages using HTML and CSS. 
    In this assignment, I will create my own webpage(s) to show that I 
    understand the material and I am capable of applying what I have learned.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am going to start by expanding on this text to test out different concepts. 
    Then, I will change my content to the relevant topics.
