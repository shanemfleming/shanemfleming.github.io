<h3>
About Me
</h3>

<p>
I am a student currently residing in Ottawa, Ontario. I am currently attending Fleming College 
via distance education for the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) post-graduate program, with 
graduation slated for June 2021. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student at Carleton University, 
where I acquired a Bachelor of Science (Honours, with Distinction) in Environmental Science, specializing 
in Biology. My undergraduate thesis focused on investigating parasitism of the Noctuid moth <i>Hypena opulenta</i>, 
a species introduced to Eastern Canada to control invasive dog-strangling vine (<i>Vincetoxicum spp.</i>).
</p>

<p>
During my undergraduate studies, I was hired through the Federal Student Work Experience Program (FSWEP) to work 
at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) where I assisted in digitizing and databasing specimens from 
the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids, and Nematodes. From this experience working in the 
federal government, I decided I wanted to build a career in the public service in Ottawa.
</p>

<p>
Upon the completion of my studies at Fleming College, I hope to combine my skills in GIS with my 
previous education and experience in Environmental Science and Biology to work on projects dealing 
with topics such as invasive species mapping, species at risk management, and landscape ecology.
